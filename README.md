# precion_agriculture_project
I worked on a precision agriculture project in which I used various sensors to save agricultural data(temperature,humidity,soil moisture,pH). In this repository , I have included 2 databases which contain the realtime and modified values. The two python codes are for modifying the database and visualizing the results respectively.
DB_1-realtime values
DB_2-modified database with average of each parameter grouped by date
csv_convert-python code to modify the database using pandas
csv_visualize-python code to visualize the data
