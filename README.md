# precion_agriculture_project
I worked on a precision agriculture project in which we used various sensors to save agricultural data(temperature,humidity,soil moisture,pH). In this repository , I have included 2 databases which contain the realtime and modified values. The two python codes are for modifying the database and visualizing the results respectivelly.
